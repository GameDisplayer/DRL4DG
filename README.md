# DRL4DG : Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Generation using SEQ2SEQ model

## Goal :
The goal of this repository is to develop a *Dialogue Agent* which generates coherent and interesting dialogues based on *Seq2Seq Model* and *Deep Reinforcement Learning approach*.
~~We also would like to integrate some *emotion management* to make the agent empathetic.~~

## Dataset :
The dataset used is the [DailyDialog](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03957) dataset that you can download [here](http://yanran.li/dailydialog).

## Pre-requisites :
The code is deveopped using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) with a custom evironment composed of the following main packages :
- `python 3.7.9`
- `pytorch 1.5.1`
- `cudatoolkit 9.2`

## Resources :
This work is based on the [Deep Reinforcement Learning for dialogue generation](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1127.pdf) paper using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). 
In order to get some base notions, we started our work with [this PyTorch official Bot tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html) and [this repository](https://github.com/clam004/RL-Chat-pytorch).
